# Mini - Projects

As mentioned in the description, this repository contains some mini-projects that I created using different programming languages. The primary purpose of these projects is to not forget the different languages and to keep practicing them.

Currently, the languages used here are Java and Python.

# SlotMachine

Two simple implementations of a slot machine. 
- The first one, `simple_slot_machine.py` allows the player to bet on a single row of symbols.
- The second one, `slot_machine.py` allows the player to choose the amount that he will deposit into the machine and bet on multiple lines (up to 3).

## How to use

### **Prerequisites**
- Ensure you have **Python installed** (tested on Python **3.10.11**).  
- Clone this repository and navigate to the `SlotMachine` folder.

Run one of the following commands in the terminal: 
```
python simple_slot_machine.py
```
or
```
python slot_machine.py
```

Have fun !
